As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you\nto follow:\n\nStack\nIssues and Bugs\nFeature Requests\nSubmission Guidelines\nCoding Rules\nCommit Message Guidelines\n\nStack\nCompodoc is written in TypeScript. The compiling process use Rollup.js.\nArchitecture and operating\nSee this folder for more details: DOCS.\nDevelopment process\n\nOpen one terminal and run inside compodoc folder:\nExample :npm run start\nOpen another terminal with the source code of the demo project, and run: \nExample :node ../compodoc/bin/index-cli.js -p tsconfig.json -a screenshots -n 'TodoMVC Angular documentation' --includes additional-doc --toggleMenuItems \"'all'\" -s\n\nDebugging process\n\nInstall sleep package:\nExample :npm i sleep\nAdd these lines in index-cli.ts, after --files check:\nExample :const sleep = require('sleep');\nconst isInInspectMode = /--inspect/.test(process.execArgv.join(' '));\nif (isInInspectMode) {\n    // wait 10 seconds for debugger to connect in Chrome devtools\n    sleep.sleep(10);\n}\nOpen one terminal and run inside compodoc folder:\nExample :npm run start\nAdd debugger statement where you want to debug your code.\n\nOpen Chrome and this url: chrome://inspect.\n\nOpen another terminal with the source code of the demo project, and run:\nExample :node --inspect ../compodoc/bin/index-cli.js -p tsconfig.json -a screenshots -n 'TodoMVC Angular documentation' --includes additional-doc --toggleMenuItems \"'all'\" -s\nCompodoc will wait 10s before starting when it detects --inspect flag.\n\nOpen the debug window in Chrome, and click inspect.\n\n\n Found an Issue?\nIf you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.\n Want a Feature?\nYou can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub\nRepository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.\nFirst, open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.\n Submission Guidelines\n Submitting an Issue\nBefore you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.\nWe want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs, we will systematically ask you to provide a minimal reproduction scenario. Having a reproducible scenario gives us wealth of important information without going back & forth to you with additional questions like:\n\nversion of compodoc, Node.js used\n.tsconfig.json configuration\nand most importantly - a use-case that fails\n\nA minimal reproduce scenario using allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out coding problem) as well as confirm that we are fixing the right problem.\nWe will be insisting on a minimal reproduce scenario in order to save maintainers time, and ultimately be able to fix more bugs. Interestingly, from our experience users often find coding problems themselves while preparing a minimal repository. We understand that sometimes it might be hard to extract essential bits of code from a larger code-base, but we really need to isolate the problem before we can fix it.\nUnfortunately, we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduction, so if we don't hear back from you, we are going to close an issue that don't have enough info to be reproduced.\nYou can file new issues by filling out our new issue form.\n Submitting a Pull Request (PR)\nBefore you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:\n\nI use Git flow for the development.\n\nSearch GitHub for an open or closed Pull Request\nthat relates to your submission.\n\nMake your changes in a new git branch\nExample :git checkout -b my-fix-branch develop\nCreate your patch, including appropriate test cases.\n\nFollow our Coding Rules.\n\nEnsure that all tests pass\n\nGenerate a new project with angular-cli:\nExample :ng new test-pr\nTest that a new project runs correctly:\nExample :cd test-pr\ncompodoc -p src/tsconfig.json\nCommit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our\ncommit message conventions.\nExample :git commit -aNote: the optional commit -a command line option will automatically \"add\" and \"rm\" edited files.\n\nPush your branch to GitHub:\nExample :git push origin my-fix-branch\nIn GitHub, send a pull request to compodoc/compodoc:develop.\n\nIf I suggest changes then\n\nMake the required updates.\n\nRe-run the tests and retest your sample generated project to ensure tests are still passing.\n\nRebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):\nExample :git rebase master -i\ngit push -f\n\n\n\nThat's it! Thank you for your contribution!\nAfter your pull request is merged\nAfter your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes\nfrom the main (upstream) repository:\n\nDelete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:\nExample :git push origin --delete my-fix-branch\nCheck out the develop branch:\nExample :git checkout develop -f\nDelete the local branch:\nExample :git branch -D my-fix-branch\nUpdate your develop with the latest upstream version:\nExample :git pull --ff upstream develop\n\nFork the compodoc project\nGo to the compodoc project and click on the \"fork\" button. You can then clone your own fork of the project, and start working on it.\nPlease read the Github forking documentation for more information\nSet NPM to use the cloned project\nIn your cloned compodoc project, type npm link.\nThis will do a symbolic link from the global node_modules version to point to this folder, so when we run compodoc, you will now use the development version of Compodoc.\nFor testing, you will want to generate an application with angular-cli, and run compodoc installed globally.\nExample :compodoc ... Coding Rules\nTo ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:\n\nAll features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs (unit-tests or e2e-tests).\nAll public API methods must be documented. (Details TBC).\nWe follow Google's JavaScript Style Guide, but wrap all code at\n100 characters.\n\n Commit Message Guidelines\nWe have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to more\nreadable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history. But also,\nwe use the git commit messages to generate the Angular CLI change log.\nCommit Message Format\nEach commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer. The header has a special\nformat that includes a type, a scope and a subject:\nExample :(): \n\n\n\nThe header is mandatory and the scope of the header is optional.\nAny line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier\nto read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.\nRevert\nIf the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with revert: , followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body, it should say: This reverts commit ., where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.\nType\nMust be one of the following:\n\nbuild: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies\nci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts\ndocs: Documentation only changes\nfeat: A new feature\nfix: A bug fix\nperf: A code change that improves performance\nrefactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature\nstyle: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing\nsemi-colons, etc)\ntest: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests\n\nScope\nThe scope should be the name of the npm package affected as perceived by the person reading changelog generated from the commit messages.\nSubject\nThe subject contains succinct description of the change:\n\nuse the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\"\ndon't capitalize first letter\nno dot (.) at the end\n\nBody\nJust as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not There are currently a few exceptions to the \"use package name\" rule:\n\npackaging: used for changes that change the npm package layout in all of our packages, e.g. public path changes, package.json changes done to all packages, d.ts file/format changes, changes to bundles, etc.\nchangelog: used for updating the release notes in CHANGELOG.md.\nnone/empty string: useful for style, test and refactor changes that are done across all packages (e.g. style: add missing semicolons)\n\nBreaking Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.\nA detailed explanation can be found in this document.\nFinancial contributions\nWe also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our open collective.\nAnyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be \"merged\" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.\nCredits\nContributors\nThank you to all the people who have already contributed to compodoc!\n\nBackers\nThank you to all our backers!

generated for a simple TodoMVC application.\nFeatures\n\nClean, simple design — Navigate the documentation on the left side, read it on the right.\n\nBeautiful themes — Seven themes are available from well known documentation tools like Gitbook, Read the Docs and projects like Vagrant, Laravel, Postmark and Stripe.\n\nSearch — Includes a powerful search engine (lunr.js) for easily finding what you're looking for.\n\nAutomatic table of contents — API table of contents is generated using elements found during files parsing.\n\nJSDoc light support — Support for @param, @returns, @link, @ignore and @example tags.\n\nDocumentation coverage — Get the documentation coverage report of your project.\n\nAngular CLI-friendly — Supports Angular CLI projects out-of-the-box.\n\nOffline — No server needed, no sources uploaded online, documentation generated entirely offline.\n\nOpen-source and on npm — Use it directly in your project using npm and a single script—that's it!\n\n\nDocumentation\nOfficial documentation has moved to https://compodoc.github.io/website/.\nInstallation\nReady to get started?
