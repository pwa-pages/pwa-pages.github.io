# Watcher Scripts

This repository contains a set of watcher scripts designed for use on **Ubuntu Linux**. These scripts help automate and monitor various processes or conditions, making them ideal for setting up automated workflows or system monitoring.

### Available Scripts

   This script unlocks the watcher. To use it:
   - Place the file in the watcher directory.
