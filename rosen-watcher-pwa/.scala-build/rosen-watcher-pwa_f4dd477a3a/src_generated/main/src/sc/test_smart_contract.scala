// Heads or Tails game
//   One player create the game and choose 0 or 1
//   The second player needs to guess the first player choice
//   To hide the first player choice, he creates a secret and an hash to provide the hashed result to the other player.
//   The first player also choose the game price and the duration
//   The funds of the first player can be refunded after the end of the game if it did not occured
//   The second player is able to create the game transaction, providing his choice and the hash of the choice of the player 1
//   Once the transaction is signed, the first player can reaveal is choice and its secret to the second player
//   Both players tries to widthraw the fund only the winner can succeed
//   If the player 1 does not provide its secret and answer, the player 2 wins by default at the end of the game duration
